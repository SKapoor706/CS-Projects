Assignment: Create a game in Java using Greenfoot, a software used to develop simple games and graphical simulations.

Summary: My game was an emulation of an "open world" Pac-Man type game where the player would control a rabbit trying to capture strawberries while also trying to avoid snakes. The game would end when a snake would catch the rabbit.

Notes: To run this program, you must have an updated Greenfoot environment
